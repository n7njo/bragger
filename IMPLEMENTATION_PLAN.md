- [ ] Frontend: Rebuild and deploy with new modal
- [ ] Database: Apply teamSize removal migration
- [ ] Test: Full functionality verification

## Phase 2: Milestone Tracking System (PRIORITY: HIGH)
**Estimated Time: 4-5 hours**
**Goal: Add milestone functionality for progress tracking**

### 2.1 Backend Milestone Infrastructure
- [ ] Database: Create milestones table with proper relations

- [ ] Test: Milestone CRUD operations in UI

### 2.3 Enhanced Achievement Creation
- [ ] Frontend: Add milestone planning to achievement form
- [ ] Frontend: Template milestones for common project types
- [ ] Backend: Bulk milestone creation with achievements
- [ ] Test: End-to-end achievement + milestones creation

## Phase 3: User Authentication System (PRIORITY: MEDIUM)
**Estimated Time: 6-8 hours**
**Goal: Multi-user support with secure authentication**

### 3.1 Backend Authentication Infrastructure
- [ ] Backend: Install authentication dependencies
- [ ] Backend: User model and database schema
- [ ] Backend: JWT middleware and auth controllers
- [ ] Backend: Password hashing and validation
- [ ] Backend: User-scoped data access
- [ ] Test: Authentication endpoints

### 3.2 Database Migration for Multi-User
- [ ] Database: Create users table
- [ ] Database: Add userId to existing models
- [ ] Database: Create default admin user
- [ ] Database: Migrate existing data to default user
- [ ] Database: Add foreign key constraints
- [ ] Backup: Create database backup before migration

### 3.3 Frontend Authentication UI
- [ ] Frontend: Login/Register components
- [ ] Frontend: Auth context and state management
- [ ] Frontend: Token storage and management

### 3.4 Integration and Security
- [ ] Backend: Environment-specific JWT secrets
- [ ] Backend: Rate limiting for auth endpoints
- [ ] Frontend: Automatic token refresh
- [ ] Frontend: Logout functionality
- [ ] Security: Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Test: Security testing and edge cases

## Phase 4: Production Deployment & Polish (PRIORITY: LOW)
**Estimated Time: 3-4 hours**
**Goal: Production-ready deployment with monitoring**

### 4.1 Production Configuration
- [ ] Kubernetes: Update secrets and ConfigMaps
- [ ] Backend: Production environment variables
- [ ] Database: Production migration strategy
- [ ] Frontend: Production build configuration
- [ ] Security: HTTPS and security headers

### 4.2 Monitoring and Maintenance
- [ ] Backend: Health checks and metrics
- [ ] Database: Backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Frontend: Error monitoring and reporting
- [ ] Documentation: Deployment and maintenance guides
- [ ] Testing: End-to-end production testing

## Phase 5: Advanced Features (FUTURE)
**Estimated Time: 8-10 hours**
**Goal: Advanced functionality for power users**

### 5.1 Enhanced Milestone Features
- [ ] Milestone templates for different project types
- [ ] Milestone dependencies and prerequisites
- [ ] Time tracking and estimates
- [ ] Progress visualization and charts
- [ ] Milestone notifications and reminders

### 5.2 Collaboration Features
- [ ] Team workspaces and shared projects
- [ ] Achievement sharing and visibility
- [ ] Comments and feedback on milestones
- [ ] Activity feeds and notifications
- [ ] Export and reporting features

### 5.3 AI Integration Enhancements
- [ ] AI-suggested milestones based on project type
- [ ] Progress prediction and recommendations
- [ ] Automated milestone generation from GitHub issues
- [ ] Smart categorization and tagging
- [ ] Performance analytics and insights

## Implementation Strategy

### Agent Assignment Plan
1. **Agent 1 (Backend Specialist)**: Phases 1.1, 2.1, 3.1-3.2
2. **Agent 2 (Frontend Specialist)**: Phases 1.2, 2.2-2.3, 3.3
3. **Agent 3 (DevOps Specialist)**: Phases 1.3, 3.4, 4.1-4.2
4. **Agent 4 (Testing Specialist)**: Cross-phase testing and validation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Database Backups**: Before each migration
- **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy and test each phase separately
- **Rollback Strategy**: Maintain previous working versions
- **Feature Flags**: Toggle new features on/off in production
- **User Communication**: Notify users of upcoming changes

### Success Criteria
- **Phase 1**: Team size removed, modal working, no regression
- **Phase 2**: Milestones fully functional, integrated with achievements
- **Phase 3**: Multi-user system working, secure authentication
- **Phase 4**: Production-stable, monitored, documented
- **Phase 5**: Advanced features enhancing user productivity

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Database schema partially updated (status, githubUrl added)
- ‚úÖ Backend types and interfaces updated  
- ‚úÖ Authentication controllers and middleware created
- ‚úÖ Milestone controllers and routes prepared
- üöß Integration and deployment pending
- ‚ùå Frontend changes not started
- ‚ùå Database migrations incomplete

## Next Steps
1. Execute Phase 1 to establish stable foundation
2. Deploy and test Phase 1 changes
3. Begin Phase 2 milestone implementation
4. Evaluate authentication priority based on user feedback
5. Plan production deployment strategy
